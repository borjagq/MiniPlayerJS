# MiniPlayerJS

MiniPlayerJS is a tiny plugin for jQuery that rdisplays a small full-html audio player.


## Getting started ðŸš€

Follow these instructions to use MiniPlayerJS on your project.


### Pre-requisites ðŸ“‹

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development and production machines:

* jQuery - [Download jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/). Of course, being a jQuery plugin, MiniPlayerJS needs jQuery to work.

### Installation ðŸ”§

Include MiniPlayerJS's .js and .css files on your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="miniplayer.css">
<script src="miniplayer.js"></script>
```


### Initialization ðŸ“¦

The MiniPlayerJS needs to be initiated when the target DOM element is ready. The safest bet is to start it on window `onload` event or jQuery's document.ready, but it can also be launched on a script tag positioned below the element.

```html
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../src/miniplayer.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../src/miniplayer.css">
</head>
<body>
	<div id="play_box"></div>
	<script type="text/javascript">

		var song = {
			name: 'Hey',
			author: 'Bensound',
			audio: [{
				src: 'bensound-hey.mp3',
				type: 'audio/mpeg'
			}]
		};

		$("#play_box").miniPlayer(song)

	</script>

```
